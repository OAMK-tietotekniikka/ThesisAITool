### **Areas for Improvement**  

#### **1. Writing & Clarity Issues**  
   - **Grammar & Typos**:  
     - Some sentences are awkwardly phrased or contain errors (e.g., _"they are addicted to one another‚Äôs efforts"_ ‚Üí likely meant "interdependent").  
     - Repeated phrases (e.g., "Conversion Rate Optimisation with Improvement of User Experience" appears twice at the start).  
   - **Wordiness**: Some explanations could be more concise.  

   **Suggested Fix**:  
   - Proofread carefully or use tools like Grammarly.  
   - Simplify complex sentences (e.g., _"The study employed a research methodology that involved combining existing literature and analysing empirical data."_ ‚Üí _"The study analyzed existing literature and empirical data."_).  

#### **2. Lack of Original Research**  
   - The thesis relies heavily on **secondary sources** (articles, reports).  
   - Missing **primary research** (e.g., case studies, user testing, A/B test results).  

   **Suggested Fix**:  
   - Include a **small case study** (e.g., analyzing a website‚Äôs UX changes and their impact on conversions).  
   - Conduct a **survey/interview** with UX designers or marketers.  

#### **3. Formatting & Consistency Issues**  
   - **References**:  
     - Some URLs are incomplete (e.g., [25], [26], [27] are empty).  
     - Inconsistent citation style (some have dates, some don‚Äôt).  
   - **Figures**:  
     - Only a few figures are referenced (e.g., Figure 1), but others are missing (e.g., Figures [2]-[11]).  
   - **Spacing & Repetition**:  
     - The title is repeated unnecessarily at the beginning.  

   **Suggested Fix**:  
   - Use a **consistent citation format** (e.g., APA or IEEE).  
   - Ensure all references are complete.  
   - Remove redundant title repetitions.  

#### **4. Weak Research Methodology Section**  
   - The methodology is briefly mentioned but lacks depth.  
   - No clear explanation of **how data was analyzed** (e.g., qualitative vs. quantitative methods).  

   **Suggested Fix**:  
   - Expand the **Research** section (Chapter 4) to explain:  
     - How articles were selected (systematic review?).  
     - Criteria for evaluating UX impact on CRO.  

#### **5. Limited Discussion on UX vs. UI**  
   - While UX and UI are differentiated, the **practical implications** for CRO could be expanded.  
   - Example: How does a **better UI** (e.g., button placement) directly affect conversions?  

   **Suggested Fix**:  
   - Add a **comparative analysis** (e.g., before/after UX changes on a real website).
