### Streng ths of the Thesis : .** Clear Focus and Relevance **: - The thesis addresses a timely and practical topic — ** linking UX design to conversion rate optimization ( C RO )** — which is highly relevant to digital businesses .- The objectives are well -defined , emphasizing the interplay between UX and C RO to improve business outcomes .2 .** Logical Structure **: - The chapters are organized coherent ly , starting with foundational concepts ( UX / UI design , C RO history ) and progressing to their relationship and practical implications .- The inclusion of ** digital strategy , development workflows , and testing phases ** provides a holistic view of the design process .3 .** Practical Insights **: - The thesis incorporates actionable strategies for improving UX and C RO , such as developing style guides , usability testing , and pre -la unch optimization .- References to ** industry reports , case studies ( e .g ., A /B testing , customer satisfaction metrics ) **, and user research methods ground the work in real -world applications .4 .** Com prehensive Definitions **: - Clear explanations of key concepts like ** UI vs .UX , C RO principles , and usability testing ** demonstrate a solid grasp of foundational topics .5 .** Use of Visual A ids ( Intent ional ) **: - Mentions of figures ( e .g ., Figure 1 : UX Research Methods Framework ) suggest an effort to illustrate complex ideas , though the figures themselves are missing in the provided content .--- ### Areas for Improvement : 1 .** The sis Structure and Organization **: - ** Rep et itive Content **: The abstract , introduction , and some sections ( e .g ., definitions of UI / UX ) repeat ideas without adding new insights .Stream lining or merging sections could improve flow .- ** Missing Figures **: The figure references ( e .g ., Figure 1 ) are incomplete , weakening the support for key arguments .Including visuals would enhance clarity .- ** Chapter 4 ( Research ) **: This section is under developed .It lacks specific data , case studies , or original analysis to validate the proposed UX -C RO relationship .Adding primary research ( e .g ., A /B test results ) would strengthen claims .2 .** Method ology Cl arity **: - The methodology is vague .Phrases like “ comb ining existing literature and analysing empirical data ” need elaboration : What specific articles or datasets were analyzed ? Were qualitative / quant itative methods used ? How was data synthesized ? 3 .** Depth of Analysis **: - ** Surface -Level Discussion **: While UX and C RO principles are listed ( e .g ., usability he uristics , A /B testing ), there ’ s limited critical analysis of their * inter play *.For example , how do specific UI elements ( e .g ., button placement ) directly impact conversions ? - ** L ack of Counter arguments **: The thesis presents UX -C RO synergy as universally beneficial but doesn ’ t address scenarios where UX goals ( e .g ., minimal ism ) might conflict with C RO goals ( e .g ., aggressive CT As ).4 .** Writing Quality **: - ** Gram matical Errors **: Phrases like “ add icted to one another ’ s efforts ” are awkward or incorrect .Copy ed iting for clarity and grammar is essential .- ** In consistent Terminology **: Sh ifting between “ Conversion Rate Optim isation ” ( UK spelling ) and “ optim ization ” ( US spelling ) creates inconsistency .5 .** References and Citations **: - ** Format ting Issues **: URLs are inconsist ently formatted ( e .g ., mixed date formats , missing hyper links ).Follow a standard citation style ( APA , IEEE , etc .).- ** Over re liance on Non -A c ademic Sources **: Many references are blog posts or guides ( e .g ., Hub Spot , Shopify ).While practical , incorporating peer -reviewed studies would bolster academic rigor .- ** Place holder Ent ries **: References [ 25 ], [ 26 ], etc ., are empty and should be removed or completed .6 .** Practical Application **: - The thesis proposes strategies ( e .g ., developing style guides ) but lacks implementation examples .Including a case study ( e .g ., a website redesign leading to improved C RO metrics ) would demonstrate applicability .7 .** Conclusion **: - The conclusion rest ates findings without synthes izing insights or discussing implications for future research .Expanding on limitations and recommendations would add depth .--- ### Recommendations for Revision : .** En h ance the Research Chapter **: - Conduct ( or reference ) a case study analyzing UX changes ( e .g ., simplified checkout flow ) and their impact on conversion rates .- Include visuals ( charts , heat maps ) to illustrate UX -C RO correlations .2 .** Cl ar ify Methodology **: - Specify the literature review process ( e .g ., databases searched , inclusion criteria ) and empirical data sources ( e .g ., Google Analytics metrics , user surveys ).3 .** Deep en Critical Analysis **: - Discuss trade -offs between UX and C RO ( e .g ., clutter vs .clarity ) and how to balance them .- Compare conflicting theories ( e .g ., Nielsen ’ s usability he uristics vs .aggressive C RO tactics ).4 .** Impro ve Academic Rig or **: - Replace placeholder references and add peer -reviewed sources ( e .g ., journals like * Journal of Us ability Studies * or * Comput ers in Human Behavior * ).5 .** Copy edit Thorough ly **: - Rev ise awkward phrasing , ensure consistent terminology , and fix grammatical errors .By addressing these areas , the thesis will strengthen its academic contribution and practical value for businesses seeking to optimize digital experiences .[STREAM_COMPLETE] ================================================================================ GRADING PURPOSES AND OBJECTIVES...### Grad ing and Analysis of the Thesis : " Conversion Rate Optim isation with Improvement of User Experience " #### ** 1 .Cl arity and Specific ity of Research Objectives ** Grade : B ** Stre ng ths **: The primary objective — expl oring the relationship between UX design and conversion rate optimization ( C RO )— is clearly stated in the abstract and introduction .For example , the thesis explicitly states its aim to " g ather information on the influence of UX design on user behavior and conversion rates " and " offer a general solution for improving UX design ." Sub -object ives , such as analyzing UX / UI elements ( e .g ., functionality , usability testing ) and C RO principles ( e .g ., A /B testing , data -driven decision -making ), are outlined in chapters 2 and 3 .** Weak nesses **: The term " general solution " is vague .Specific goals , such as " ident ifying the top three UX design elements that directly impact e -commerce conversion rates ," would strengthen clarity .Objectives overlap with descriptive content ( e .g ., defining UX vs .UI ) rather than focusing on actionable research outcomes .--- #### ** 2 .Alignment Between Objectives and Methodology ** Grade : C + ** Stre ng ths **: The thesis acknowledges reliance on literature reviews and empirical data analysis ( e .g ., " analy zing techniques applied on real e -commerce websites ").For instance , Chapter 4 references UX statistics and their influence on conversions .Method ological steps like usability testing and A /B testing ( Section 3 .2 .1 ) align with the goal of improving C RO through UX .** Weak nesses **: The methodology lacks specificity .The thesis states it uses " emp irical data " but does not detail whether this involves case studies , surveys , or A /B tests .For example , Section 4 .2 mentions " analy zing real e -commerce websites ," but the process ( e .g ., sample size , tools used ) is omitted .The research chapter ( Chapter 4 ) is under developed compared to the extensive theoretical coverage of UX / UI design .This creates a disconnect between the objectives and execution .--- #### ** 3 .Fe as ibility and Scope ** Grade : B -** Stre ng ths **: The scope is appropriate for a bachelor ’ s thesis , covering core topics like UX principles , C RO strategies , and their intersection .For example , sections on usability testing ( 2 .1 .1 .5 ) and conversion rate formulas ( 3 .3 .1 ) provide foundational knowledge .The 40 -page limit is managed by structuring content into digest ible sections .** Weak nesses **: Broad coverage of tangential topics ( e .g ., front end / backend development in Section 2 .7 ) dil utes the focus on UX and C RO .The lack of primary research ( e .g ., original case studies or user testing ) limits depth .The thesis relies heavily on secondary sources , which is feasible but reduces originality .--- #### ** 4 .Contribution to the Field ** Grade : C + ** Stre ng ths **: Synt hes izes existing knowledge about UX and C RO , such as linking usability principles ( Section 3 .3 .4 .1 ) to conversion metrics .Em phas izes the interdependence of UX and C RO , a valuable reminder for digital marketers ( e .g ., " poor UX design often results in decreased conversion metrics ").** Weak nesses **: Offers no novel insights or frameworks .For example , the " action able strategies " proposed ( e .g ., style guides , usability testing ) are standard industry practices .Limited critical analysis of conflicting viewpoints ( e .g ., trade -offs between aesthetic UI and functional UX ).--- #### ** 5 .Practical Relevance ** Grade : B ** Stre ng ths **: Provides actionable advice , such as developing style guides ( Section 2 .6 ) and pre -la unch testing protocols ( Section 2 .8 ).References real -world tools ( e .g ., CS AT scores in 3 .3 .3 ) and methodologies ( e .g ., A /B testing in 3 .2 .1 ) used in industry .** Weak nesses **: Strategies lack specificity .For instance , the thesis advocates for " m etic ulous UX design practices " but does not prioritize or contextual ize them ( e .g ., how to adapt principles for mobile vs .desktop ).The research section ( Chapter 4 ) does not include concrete examples of UX improvements leading to measurable C RO gains ( e .g ., " Button color changes increased conversions by X % ").--- ### Summary of Grades : .** Cl arity of Objectives **: B .** Alignment **: C + .** Fe as ibility **: B - .** Cont ribution **: C + .** Practical Relevance **: B ### Recommendations for Improvement : ** Shar pen Objectives **: Define specific , measurable goals ( e .g ., " Identify the impact of navigation simplicity on e -commerce checkout rates ").** Method ological Detail **: Clar ify research methods ( e .g ., " Analy zed 10 e -commerce sites using heat maps and Google Analytics ").** Focus on Original ity **: Conduct primary research ( e .g ., user surveys or A /B tests ) to generate new insights .** Practical Examples **: Include case studies demonstrating how UX changes directly improved CR ( e .g ., before -and -after metrics ).Overall , the thesis effectively establishes the UX -C RO relationship but needs deeper analysis and originality to excel in academic and practical contributions .[STREAM_COMPLETE] ================================================================================ GRADING THEORETICAL FOUNDATION...** Evaluation of Theoretical Foundation in the Thesis ** --- ### 1 .** Depth and Bread th of Theoretical Framework ** Grade : B -** Stre ng ths **: The thesis provides a broad overview of core theoretical concepts , including UX / UI design principles , conversion rate optimization ( C RO ) methodologies , and usability testing .It defines foundational ideas like information architecture , user testing , A /B testing , and customer satisfaction metrics ( e .g ., CS AT ).The framework spans multiple domains : digital marketing , human -com puter interaction ( H CI ), and e -commerce , demonstrating interdisciplinary awareness .** Weak nesses **: ** L acks depth ** in critical areas .For example , while the thesis outlines " key usability principles " ( e .g ., consistency , feedback ), it does not explicitly reference established frameworks like Nielsen ’ s 10 Us ability He uristics or F itts ’ s Law , which are foundational to UX theory .** N arrow scope **: The C RO section focuses on generic best practices ( e .g ., " sim pl ify forms ") but om its advanced theories like behavioral economics ( n udge theory , scarcity ) or psychological triggers ( e .g ., social proof , reciprocity ), which are central to modern C RO .** In complete definitions **: The distinction between UX and UI is covered , but the discussion lacks grounding in authoritative definitions from sources like ISO 924 1 ( erg onomics of human -system interaction ).** Example **: section on " User Experience Research Methods " ( Fig .1 ) briefly categor izes methods ( att itudinal vs .behavioral ) but fails to contextual ize them within academic frameworks like the " Research Wheel " or triang ulation methods .--- ### 2 .** App ropri ate Use of Relevant Theories and Concepts ** Grade : C + ** Stre ng ths **: Basic terminology ( e .g ., conversion rate formula , usability testing ) is correctly defined and applied .References to industry practices ( e .g ., creating style guides , pre -la unch testing ) align with standard UX literature .** Weak nesses **: ** Over -re liance on secondary sources **: Many cited references are blog posts ( e .g ., Event ige Media Group , Neil Patel ) rather than peer -reviewed research .For instance , the discussion of UX statistics cites a blog post by Georg ie Peru ( reference 11 ) instead of academic studies like those from the Nielsen Norman Group .** Super fic ial integration of theories **: The thesis mentions " digital strategy " and " customer loyalty " but does not engage with theoretical models like the Technology Acceptance Model ( T AM ) or the SERV QUAL framework for service quality .** Example **: section on " User Experience Design " cites Steve K rug ’ s * Don ’ t Make Me Think * ( reference 6 ) but does not explore its foundational arguments ( e .g ., cognitive load reduction ) in depth .--- ### 3 .** Integration of Theoretical and Practical Elements ** Grade : B ** Stre ng ths **: The thesis links UX design stages ( e .g ., wire fram ing , usability testing ) to practical outcomes like conversion rate improvement .For example , it connects " pre -la unch testing " to bug detection and user experience refinement .The section on " Front end and Back end Development " acknowledges technical constraints ( e .g ., responsiveness ) that impact user experience , grounding theory in implementation .** Weak nesses **: ** L ack of case studies or empirical data **: While the " Research " chapter claims to analyze " real e -commerce websites ," it provides no specific examples or data ( e .g ., before / after C RO metrics ).** Generic recommendations **: Pro posals like " speed of the website should be regularly optimized " are too vague to demonstrate practical application .** Example **: thesis mentions A /B testing ( reference 24 ) but does not detail how it was applied in a real -world scenario ( e .g ., altering button colors or checkout flows ) to validate theoretical claims .--- ### 4 .** Critical Analysis of Existing Literature ** Grade : C ** Stre ng ths **: The literature review identifies key themes , such as the interplay between UX and C RO , and highlights industry trends ( e .g ., mobile responsiveness ).** Weak nesses **: ** No critical evaluation **: Sources are summarized rather than crit iqu ed .For instance , the thesis cites claims like " users display increased tendency to convert with intuitive interfaces " ( p .4 ) but does not address counter arguments ( e .g ., cases where simplicity sacrifices functionality ).** Missing synthesis **: The " Research " chapter does not compare findings across studies or identify gaps in existing knowledge ( e .g ., cultural differences in UX preferences ).** Example **: section on " UX Statistics and Their Influence on Conversion " references blog -based statistics ( reference 11 ) without questioning their methodological validity or sampling biases .--- ### 5 .** The oretical Contribution to the Field ** Grade : C ** Stre ng ths **: The thesis consolid ates existing knowledge on UX and C RO , offering a structured overview for practitioners .It emphasizes the symbiotic relationship between UX and C RO , aligning with current industry narratives .** Weak nesses **: ** No novel insights **: The thesis does not propose new frameworks , challenge existing paradigms , or identify under stud ied areas .For example , it does not explore emerging trends like AI -driven personal ization in C RO .** Rep et itive content **: Sections like " Definition of User Interface Design " and " Definition of User Experience Design " re hash common knowledge without adding original analysis .** Example **: conclusion reiter ates that " UX design influences conversion metrics " ( p .32 ) but does not advance this insight beyond a rest atement of the premise .--- ### ** Overall Feedback ** thesis demonstrates a foundational understanding of UX and C RO concepts but struggles with ** super fic ial theoretical engagement ** and ** lack of critical analysis **.While it outlines key principles , its reliance on non -ac ademic sources and generic recommendations limits its scholarly contribution .** Recommend ations for Improvement **: .Integ rate peer -reviewed research and established theoretical frameworks ( e .g ., Nielsen ’ s he uristics , behavioral economics )..Include case studies or empirical data to ground arguments in practical evidence ..Crit ically evaluate sources ( e .g ., question the limitations of cited blog posts )..Pro pose original models or hypotheses ( e .g ., a UX -C RO optimization matrix ).** Final Grade for Theoretical Foundation **: ** C + ** A de quate but with significant room for depth , rigor , and originality .) *
