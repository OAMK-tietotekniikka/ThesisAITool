GRADING PURPOSES AND OBJECTIVES...**Grade: 4 (Good)**  

**Rationale:**  
The thesis establishes a clear purpose—exploring the relationship between UX design and conversion rate optimization (CRO)—and outlines actionable strategies for improving CR through UX practices. The objectives are grounded in theoretical foundations (literature review, usability principles) and practical applications (real e-commerce case studies). It emphasizes professional field development by proposing business-oriented solutions, such as UI/UX best practices and testing methodologies.  

However, while the purpose aligns with both working life and theory, the objectives could be more explicitly defined (e.g., specific, measurable goals). The reliance on existing literature without novel empirical data slightly limits the depth of practical application. The thesis structure follows a logical plan, and the intent to apply findings to professional contexts is evident but not exhaustively detailed. This aligns with the **Good (4–3)** tier, specifically a **4**, as it effectively connects UX and CR for professional development but lacks the originality or granularity required for an "Excellent" rating.

GRADING THEORETICAL FOUNDATION...**Grade: 4 (Good)**  
**Theoretical Foundation Assessment:**

1. **Critical and Creative Thinking (Moderate):**  
   The thesis effectively synthesizes existing knowledge from various sources, presenting a coherent overview of UX and CRO concepts. However, it lacks significant originality or critical analysis of the cited theories, relying more on descriptive summaries than novel insights.

2. **Topical and Purposeful (Strong):**  
   The content is relevant, addressing modern UX and CRO practices. The connection between UX design and conversion rates is clearly established with practical strategies, aligning well with the thesis's objectives.

3. **Use of Sources (Adequate):**  
   Utilizes a mix of industry reports, blogs, and a few academic sources (e.g., Steve Krug). While versatile, the reliance on non-peer-reviewed industry articles slightly limits academic depth. Key principles (e.g., usability, A/B testing) are covered but not rigorously critiqued.

4. **Structure and Application:**  
   The theoretical framework is logically organized, covering UI/UX design processes, CRO methodologies, and their interdependencies. However, the research chapter (Ch4) lacks original empirical data, leaning instead on existing statistics, which weakens the depth of analysis.

**Strengths:**  
- Clear definitions and differentiation of UX/UI and CRO.  
- Comprehensive coverage of design processes (wireframing, testing) and optimization strategies (A/B testing).  
- Practical focus on actionable recommendations for businesses.  

**Weaknesses:**  
- Limited critical evaluation of sources (e.g., no discussion of limitations or controversies in UX/CRO theories).  
- Fewer academic references and minimal original research data.  

**Conclusion:**  
The thesis provides a solid, well-structured theoretical foundation using diverse industry sources, making it a **Good (4)** effort. To achieve "Excellent," deeper critical analysis and inclusion of peer-reviewed research would be needed.
