GRADING PURPOSES AND OBJECTIVES...**Grade: 5 (Excellent)**

**Evaluation of Purpose and Objectives:**

1. **Clarity and Foundation in Working Life & Theory:**  
   The thesis establishes a clear purpose: to analyze Finland as a target market for Vietnamese coffee, addressing the discrepancy between Vietnam’s global coffee export dominance and its minimal presence in Finland. This is rooted in real-world trade dynamics (working life relevance) and employs established theoretical frameworks like Porter’s Five Forces and SWOT analysis (theoretical foundation). The objectives directly address practical challenges faced by businesses (e.g., market entry barriers, competitive analysis) while grounding the investigation in academic rigor.

2. **Application to Professional Development:**  
   The study explicitly aims to provide actionable insights for Finnish importers, Vietnamese exporters, and entrepreneurs. By identifying opportunities/threats and offering strategic suggestions (e.g., targeting Robusta coffee despite Finnish Arabica preferences), it bridges academic research with practical decision-making in the coffee industry. This aligns with the intention to apply results to professional field development.

3. **Depth and Specificity:**  
   The objectives are precise and problem-focused, addressing both the "why" (low market share) and "what" (opportunities/threats). The use of industry analysis tools ensures the findings are methodologically robust and relevant to stakeholders in international trade and market strategy.

**Conclusion:**  
The purpose and objectives are well-articulated, theoretically sound, and directly applicable to professional contexts. They demonstrate a strong alignment with both academic and practical goals, warranting an **Excellent (5)** rating.GRADING THEORETICAL FOUNDATION...**Grade: 5 (Excellent)**  

**Rationale:**  
The Purpose and Objectives section of Bishal Regmi’s thesis clearly aligns with the "Excellent" criteria for the following reasons:  

1. **Working Life Relevance**:  
   - The thesis addresses a practical, real-world issue in international trade: Vietnam’s underperformance in the Finnish coffee market despite its global dominance. This problem directly impacts businesses and aligns with the needs of coffee importers, exporters, and entrepreneurs.  

2. **Theoretical Foundation**:  
   - The study employs robust analytical frameworks like **Porter’s Five Forces** and **SWOT analysis** to evaluate market dynamics. These models provide a structured, evidence-based foundation for understanding competition, opportunities, and threats.  

3. **Application to Professional Development**:  
   - The objectives aim to provide actionable insights for decision-making in the coffee industry. By identifying barriers to market entry (e.g., coffee type preferences, quality standards) and proposing strategies for Robusta coffee, the thesis directly contributes to the development of the professional field.  

4. **Clarity and Specificity**:  
   - The purpose and objectives are concise and well-defined. The research questions (“reasons for low Vietnamese coffee imports” and “opportunities/threats”) are focused, ensuring the analysis remains targeted and relevant to stakeholders.  

5. **Boundary Considerations**:  
   - The scope is appropriately bounded (e.g., focusing on Finland as a target market, excluding financial analysis) to maintain depth while acknowledging limitations.  

**Improvement Note**:  
While the section is excellent, explicitly linking the theoretical frameworks (Porter’s Five Forces, SWOT) to professional application (e.g., how findings can inform marketing strategies) would further strengthen the alignment with working life relevance.  

Overall, the Purpose and Objectives are exemplary in grounding academic rigor in practical industry needs, justifying a grade of **5**.
