improvements.)*================================================================================GRADING PURPOSES AND OBJECTIVES...###**Evaluation of Thesis:"Conversion Rate Optim isation with Improvement of User Experience"**####**1.Cl arity and Specific ity of Research Objectives**Grade:Good(B+)**thesis clearly states its primary objective:to investigate the influence of**User Experience(UX)design on user behavior and conversion rates**while proposing general solutions for improving UX design.The abstract and introduction outline the research focus well,emphasizing the relationship between UX and**Conversion Rate Optimization(C RO)**.However,the objectives could be**more specific**in terms of:**Meas urable outcomes**(e.g.,"increase conversion rates by X%through UX improvements").**Target industries**(e.g.,e-commerce,SaaS,etc.).**Specific UX elements**being tested(e.g.,navigation,load speed,call-to-action placement).**Example from Thesis:**The abstract mentions_"off ering a general solution on improving User Experience design,"_but it lacks a**quant ifiable benchmark**for success.The research could benefit from**hyp othesis-driven objectives**,such as:_"A/B testing will confirm that simplified checkout UX increases conversions by 15%."_---####**2.Alignment Between Objectives and Methodology**Grade:Good(B)**methodology relies on**liter ature review and empirical data analysis**,which aligns with the goal of understanding UX-C RO relationships.However:**No primary data collection**(e.g.,user testing,A/B testing,heat maps)is mentioned,which weak ens empirical validation.The thesis cites**industry reports and articles**,but a**mixed-m ethod approach**(qual itative+quantitative)would strengthen findings.**Example from Thesis:**The section on**"UX Research Methods"**(Fig.1)lists**att itudinal vs.behavioral methods**,but the thesis does not apply them directly in a case study.The claim that_"users display increased tendency to convert with intuitive interfaces"_is supported by literature but lacks**first-hand experimental validation**.**S uggestion:**Include**real-world case studies**(e.g.,before/after UX changes in an e-commerce site).Conduct**A/B testing**(mentioned in Ch.3)to validate hypotheses.---####**3.Fe as ibility and Scope of the Research**Grade:Fair(C+)**research is**the oret ically feasible**but**l acks practical execution**:The**40-page limit**is appropriate,but the scope is**too broad**—covering UX,UI,C RO,digital strategy,and testing.**No primary data collection**(e.g.,surveys,usability tests)limits real-world applicability.**Example from Thesis:**The**"Pre-La unch Testing"**section(p.11)discusses usability testing but does not present**actual test results**.The**"UX Statistics"**section(Ch.4.2)cites external data but does not**analy ze them critically**.**S uggestion:**Narrow focus to**one industry**(e.g.,e-commerce).Conduct**small-scale UX experiments**(e.g.,heat map analysis,user feedback surveys).---####**4.Contribution to the Field**Grade:Satisf actory(B-)**thesis**sum mar izes existing knowledge**well but does not offer**nov el insights**:It reinforces**known principles**(e.g.,UX impacts C RO)but does not propose**new frameworks**.The**"Key C RO Principles"**section(Ch.3.3.4.2)lists best practices but does not**ch allenge or expand them**.**Example from Thesis:**The conclusion states:>_"This thesis underscores the critical importance of UX design in shaping user behaviour and influencing conversion metrics."_While true,this is**not a new finding**—it reiter ates**established industry knowledge**.**S uggestion:**Pro pose a**new UX-C RO framework**(e.g.,a checklist for optimizing UX for C RO).Compare**different industries**(e.g.,SaaS vs.e-commerce UX strategies).---####**5.Practical Relevance**Grade:Good(B+)**thesis is**high ly relevant**to digital marketing and UX professionals:It provides**action able strategies**(e.g.,usability testing,style guides).The**"Elements of Effective UI Design"**(Ch.2.1.1)is useful for designers.**Example from Thesis:**The**"Digital Strategy"section**(p.10)offers**p ractical steps**for aligning UX with business goals.The**"Conversion Rate Formula"**(Ch.3.3.1)is useful for marketers.**S uggestion:**Include**real-world implementation examples**(e.g.,how Amazon improved C RO via UX).Provide a**step-by-step C RO optimization guide**for businesses.---###**Final Grade:B(Good,with room for improvement)****Stre ng ths:**Clear research focus on UX and C RO.Well-structured literature review.Practical insights for UX designers and marketers.####**Are as for Improvement:****More specific,measurable objectives.****Primary data collection(A/B testing,user feedback).****N arrow er scope(e.g.,focus on e-commerce UX).****Strong er contribution(new frameworks,case studies).**####**Recommend ations for Future Work:**Conduct**real-world UX experiments**(e.g.,A/B test a website redesign).Compare**different UX strategies**across industries.Develop a**p ractical UX-C RO optimization checklist**for businesses.Overall,this is a**solid thesis**that could be strengthened with**more empirical validation and specificity**.================================================================================GRADING THEORETICAL FOUNDATION...###**Evaluation of the Thesis:"Conversion Rate Optim isation with Improvement of User Experience"**G rading Criteria:Theoretical Foundation**####**1.Depth and Bread th of Theoretical Framework**Grade:Good(7/10)**thesis provides a structured overview of key concepts in**User Experience(UX)Design,User Interface(UI)Design,and Conversion Rate Optimization(C RO)**.It covers essential topics such as:**UI Design Elements**(function ality,usability testing,GUI design)**UX Design Principles**(user-centered approach,digital strategy,research methods)**C RO Fundamentals**(con version rate formula,A/B testing,usability principles)However,the theoretical framework lacks**depth in certain areas**,such as:**Psychological theories**(e.g.,cognitive load theory,Hick’s Law,F itts’s Law)that explain user behavior.**Advanced C RO models**(e.g.,persuasion techniques,neurom ark eting principles).**Comparative analysis**of different UX research methodologies beyond just listing them.**Example:**section on**"Elements of Effective User Interface Design"(2.1.1)**lists usability inspection and GUI design but does not explore how these elements interact with cognitive psychology or behavioral economics to influence conversions.####**2.Appropriate Use of Relevant Theories and Concepts**Grade:Satisf actory(6/10)**thesis correctly applies**basic UX/UI and C RO concepts**,but some areas could benefit from**more rigorous theoretical grounding**:**UI vs.UX distinction(2.10)**is explained well,referencing Interaction Design Foundation(11).**C RO principles(3.3.4.2)**are listed but not critically analyzed.**UX research methods(2.9.1)**are categorized(att itudinal vs.behavioral)but lack**just ification for selection criteria**in real-world applications.**Missing Link:**the thesis mentions**A/B testing(behavior al method)**,it does not reference**key literature**(e.g.,Koh avi et al.on A/B testing validity)or discuss**stat istical significance**in C RO experiments.####**3.Integration of Theoretical and Practical Elements**Grade:Good(7.5/10)**thesis successfully**conn ects theory to practice**in sections like:**Digital Strategy(2.3)**explains how UX planning aligns with business goals.**Pre-La unch Testing(2.8)**discusses usability testing but lacks case study examples.**Conversion Rate Formula(3.3.1)**is applied mathematically but not linked to real-world data.**Weak ness:**No**case studies**or**emp irical data**from actual C RO campaigns are provided.The**"Research"chapter(4)**is too brief and does not demonstrate how theoretical principles were tested in practice.####**4.Critical Analysis of Existing Literature**Grade:Fair(5.5/10)**thesis**sum mar izes**rather than**crit iques**literature:**Sources are cited(e.g.,Steve K rug,Interaction Design Foundation),but no debate on conflicting theories.****No synthesis of opposing views**(e.g.,Jakob Nielsen’s usability vs.emotional design by Don Norman).**L ack of recent studies**—most references are from 201 4-202 4,but no discussion of**AI-driven UX trends**.**Example:**section on**"UX Statistics and Their Influence on Conversion"(4.2)**merely lists statistics without analyzing**why**certain UX changes improve conversions.####**5.Theoretical Contribution to the Field**Grade:Limited(4/10)**thesis**does not propose new frameworks**but consolid ates existing knowledge:**No original model**linking UX and C RO beyond general recommendations.**No gap analysis**—does not identify unresolved problems in UX/C RO research.**Conclusions(5)**rest ate findings without suggesting future research directions.**Example:**stronger contribution would involve**a proposed UX-C RO optimization framework**based on the reviewed literature.###**Final Assessment&Recommendations**Overall Grade:6/10(S atisf actory,with room for improvement)****Stre ng ths:**Clear structure and coverage of UX/UI and C RO basics.Logical flow from definitions to practical applications.Good use of industry sources(e.g.,Interaction Design Foundation).**Are as for Improvement:****D eeper theoretical grounding**(e.g.,cognitive psychology in UX).**More critical engagement**with conflicting theories.**Emp irical validation**(case studies,A/B test results).**Original contribution**(pro pose a new model or framework).**Suggested Enhance ments:**Add a**compar ative analysis**of UX research methods(e.g.,when to use surveys vs.eye-t racking).Include**real-world C RO examples**(e.g.,how Amazon’s UX changes improved conversions).Discuss**emerg ing trends**(e.g.,AI-powered personal ization in UX).###**Conclusion**thesis provides a**solid foundational understanding**of UX and C RO but would benefit from**de eper theoretical analysis,empirical validation,and original insights**to elevate its academic contribution.
