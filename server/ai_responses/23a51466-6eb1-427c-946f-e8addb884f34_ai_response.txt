GRADING PURPOSES AND OBJECTIVES...**Grade: 5 (Excellent)**  

**Rationale:**  
The thesis **"Conversion Rate Optimisation with Improvement of User Experience"** achieves an **Excellent (5)** rating for its purpose and objectives based on the following alignment with the criteria:  

### 1. **Well-founded in working life and theoretical foundations**  
- The purpose directly connects UX design to conversion rate optimization (CRO), a critical metric in digital marketing and business strategy, reflecting relevance to working life.  
- Theoretical grounding is evident through comprehensive literature review (e.g., UX/UI principles, usability testing, A/B testing) and empirical data analysis, demonstrating engagement with academic and industry knowledge.  

### 2. **Application to professional field development**  
- The thesis explicitly aims to provide actionable strategies for businesses to optimize digital interfaces, fostering improved user engagement and higher conversion rates. Examples include recommendations for intuitive UI design, usability testing, and data-driven CRO practices.  
- Conclusions emphasize practical value by underlining how businesses can operationalize findings for tangible outcomes (e.g., increased sales or user retention).  

### 3. **Clarity and specificity**  
- While proposing "general solutions," the thesis avoids vagueness by detailing methodologies (e.g., usability inspection, A/B testing) and linking outcomes to real-world metrics (conversion rates). Objectives are structured to address both UX quality and business performance, ensuring coherence with professional goals.  

**Areas of strength:**  
- Integration of UX theory (e.g., style guides, user testing) with CRO best practices (e.g., hypothesis-driven testing).  
- Focus on empirical analysis and application to business contexts, bridging academic research and industry needs.  

**Minor improvement opportunities:**  
- Broader case studies or personalized solutions for niche industries could enhance specificity, but the thesis’s generalizability remains a strength for diverse applications.  

**Final verdict:** The purpose and objectives are robustly aligned with theoretical and practical contexts, merit a grade of **5**.

GRADING THEORETICAL FOUNDATION...**Grade: 4 (Good)**  

**Analysis of Theoretical Foundation:**  
The thesis presents a well-structured theoretical foundation that effectively synthesizes existing concepts in UX design and CRO. It demonstrates clear purpose and topical relevance, linking UX improvements to conversion rate optimization—a critical concern in digital marketing.  

### Strengths:  
1. **Versatile Industry and Academic Sources:**  
   - The foundation draws from a mix of academic literature (e.g., Steve Krug’s *Don’t Make Me Think*), industry reports, and practical guides, offering a balanced perspective.  
   - Key UX/UI principles (usability testing, information architecture) and CRO methodologies (A/B testing, data analysis) are clearly explained.  

2. **Purposeful Structure:**  
   - Chapters systematically build from definitions (UX vs. UI) to applied strategies (digital strategy, testing phases), aligning with the thesis goal of connecting UX to conversion metrics.  

3. **Critical Synthesis:**  
   - The author connects UX design elements (e.g., functionality, usability testing) to behavioral outcomes, emphasizing how intuitive interfaces drive conversions.  

### Areas for Improvement:  
1. **Depth of Critical Analysis:**  
   - While the foundation covers essential concepts, it largely synthesizes existing knowledge rather than offering novel theoretical insights or models. For example, the discussion of UX research methods (attitudinal vs. behavioral) is descriptive but lacks critical evaluation.  

2. **Source Rigor:**  
   - Reliance on blogs (e.g., Medium, HubSpot) and non-peer-reviewed articles limits academic robustness. Greater emphasis on peer-reviewed studies would strengthen the theoretical grounding.  

3. **Innovation:**  
   - The thesis applies established frameworks (e.g., Nielsen’s usability heuristics) but does not propose new theoretical approaches or challenge existing paradigms.  

### Conclusion:  
The theoretical foundation is **Good (4)**—it is well-organized, topical, and supported by a mix of industry and academic sources. However, it leans more on synthesis than critical originality, and some sources lack rigorous academic validation. For an "Excellent" (5) rating, deeper theoretical innovation and a stronger emphasis on peer-reviewed research would be needed.
