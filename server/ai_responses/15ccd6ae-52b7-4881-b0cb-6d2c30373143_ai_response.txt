Here is a comprehensive evaluation of the thesis based on O AM K's assessment criteria,highlighting its strengths and areas for improvement:---###**Stre ng ths**.**Clear Structure and Organization**-The thesis follows a logical flow,starting with an introduction,followed by detailed chapters on UX/UI design and C RO,and concluding with research findings.-Sections are well-labeled,and subs ections break down complex topics(e.g.,UI design elements,C RO principles)effectively.2.**Re levance and Practical Application**-The topic(C RO and UX)is highly relevant to digital marketing and IT,aligning with industry demands.-Pro poses actionable strategies(e.g.,UX research methods,style guides)that businesses can implement.3.**Use of Literature and Sources**-Draw s from a variety of credible sources(ac ademic articles,industry reports,books like*Don’t Make Me Think*).-References are cited in-text and listed comprehensively,though some formatting inconsistencies exist(see improvements).4.**Method ology**-Em pl oys a literature review approach,which is appropriate for a theoretical analysis of UX/C RO relationships.-Briefly mentions empirical data analysis(e.g.,UX statistics),though this could be expanded(see improvements).5.**Key Takeaways**-Clearly states the correlation between UX design and conversion rates,supported by examples(e.g.,intuitive interfaces improve CR).-Summar izes findings conc is ely in the conclusion,reinforcing the thesis’s purpose.---###**Are as for Improvement**.**Abstract and Introduction**-**Abstract**:Could better highlight the research gap and specific contributions(e.g.,"This study bridges X and Y by proposing Z").-**Introduction**:The background on UX/C RO is generic.Add statistics(e.g.,"88%of users abandon sites with poor UX")to emphasize urgency.2.**The oretical Framework**-**Definitions**:UI/UX definitions are clear but repetitive.Consolid ate or deepen the discussion(e.g.,contrast UX/UI with a Venn diagram).-**Original ity**:Rel ies heavily on cited sources.Add critical analysis(e.g.,"While[X]argues A,this study suggests B because...").3.**Research Methodology**-**Cl arity**:The"research"chapter lacks detail.Specify how literature was selected(e.g.,inclusion criteria,databases used).-**Emp irical Data**:Claims to analyze"real e-commerce websites"but doesn’t present case studies or data.Include examples(e.g.,A/B test results from Shopify).4.**Visual A ids and Examples**-**Figures**:Only one figure(UX research methods)is included.Add more visuals(e.g.,CR formula breakdown,UI wire frames).-**Case Studies**:Mention ed in Ch 4 but not developed.Compare two websites(good vs.poor UX)to illustrate CR impact.5.**Writing and Mechanics**-**Grammar/Cl arity**:Some awkward phrasing(e.g.,"add icted to one another’s efforts"→"inter dependent").-**Rep et ition**:UX/UI differences are explained multiple times(Ch 2,Ch 2.10).Stream line.-**Keyword Consistency**:"C RO"and"CR"are used interchangeably;standard ize to"C RO."6.**References**-**Format ting**:In consistent(e.g.,"[3,p.11-14]"vs."[11]").Use O AM K’s preferred citation style(e.g.,APA).-**Currency**:Most sources are pre-202 3.Include 202 3–202 4 studies to reflect recent trends(e.g.,AI in UX).7.**Conclusion**-**Lim itations**:A cknow ledge constraints(e.g.,"This study focused on theoretical analysis;future work could include user surveys").-**Future Work**:Suggest specific next steps(e.g.,"Test the proposed strategies in a live e-commerce environment").---###**Recommend ations for Enhancement****Add Primary Research**:Conduct a small-scale A/B test or user survey to validate claims.**Expand Case Studies**:Analyze 2–3 real-world examples(e.g.,Amazon’s checkout UX vs.a smaller retailer).**Impro ve Visual s**:Use tables to summarize UX principles(e.g.,"N ielsen’s He uristics")or CR formulas.**Proof reading**:Edit for conc isen ess(e.g.,"The first and only aspect of the system visible to the user"→"The UI is the user’s primary touch point").---###**Final Assessment**thesis provides a solid foundation on UX/C RO but would benefit from deeper analysis,clearer methodology,and practical validation.With revisions,it could meet O AM K’s criteria for originality and impact.**Grade Potential**:3–4/5(Good to Very Good)with improvements.================================================================================GRADING PURPOSES AND OBJECTIVES...###**Evaluation of Thesis:"Conversion Rate Optim isation with Improvement of User Experience"**####**1.Cl arity and Specific ity of Research Objectives**Grade:Good(B+)**thesis clearly states its primary objective:to investigate the influence of**User Experience(UX)design on user behavior and conversion rates(CR)**while proposing general solutions for improving UX to enhance CR.The introduction(p.6)and abstract provide a concise overview of the research focus.However,the objectives could be**more specific**in terms of:**Target ed industries**(e.g.,e-commerce,SaaS,etc.)**Specific UX elements**being analyzed(e.g.,navigation,load speed,C TA placement)**Quant ifiable goals**(e.g.,"increase CR by X%through UX improvements")**Example of Cl arity:**The thesis defines UX and CR well(p.7,15)and links them logically.The research question is implied but not explicitly stated(e.g.,"How does UX design impact CR?").**Impro vement S uggestion:**A structured**research question/h yp othesis**(e.g.,"Does improving UI intuit iveness increase CR by at least 10%?")would strengthen clarity.---####**2.Alignment Between Objectives and Methodology**Grade:Fair(B-)**methodology relies on**liter ature review and empirical data analysis**(p.4,30),which aligns with the exploratory nature of the research.However,there is**no clear experimental or case study application**(e.g.,A/B testing,user feedback analysis)to validate findings.**Stre ng ths:**The thesis references**UX research methods**(p.12-14)like usability testing,A/B testing,and surveys,suggesting awareness of best practices.The**CR formula**(p.18)and**UX principles**(p.20-26)are well-expl ained.**Weak nesses:****No primary data collection**(e.g.,user testing,heat maps,or real-world CR comparisons).The**"Research"chapter(p.30-31)**is brief and lacks depth in applying UX-C RO principles to real cases.**Impro vement S uggestion:**Include**a case study**(e.g.,analyzing CR changes after a UX redesign on an e-commerce site).---####**3.Fe as ibility

FOUNDATION...###**Evaluation of the Thesis:"Conversion Rate Optim isation with Improvement of User Experience"**Focus:Theoretical Foundation**####**1.Depth and Bread th of Theoretical Framework**Grade:Good(7/10)**thesis provides a structured overview of key concepts in**User Experience(UX)Design,User Interface(UI)Design,and Conversion Rate Optimization(C RO)**.It covers essential elements such as:**UI Design Principles**(function ality,usability testing,GUI components)**UX Design Process**(digital strategy,wire fram ing,style guides)**C RO Fundamentals**(A/B testing,statistical learning,business rules)However,the theoretical foundation lacks**depth in advanced models or frameworks**(e.g.,Nielsen’s Us ability He uristics,F ogg’s Behavior Model,or the Hook Model for engagement).While it references**he uristic evaluation and cognitive walk through s**,it does not explore them in detail.**Example:**The section on**"Elements of Effective User Interface Design"**(p.7-9)lists key steps(e.g.,usability testing,GUI design)but does not critically examine**why**these steps matter or how they interconnect with psychological principles.####**2.Appropriate Use of Relevant Theories and Concepts**Grade:Satisf actory(6/10)**thesis correctly identifies and defines core concepts(UX vs.UI,C RO methodologies)but sometimes**l acks theoretical rigor**.Some sections rely on**des criptive explanations**rather than**anal ytical discussions**.**Stre ng ths:**Clearly different iates**UI and UX**(p.14).Expl ains**C RO elements**(data collection,hypothesis testing)(p.17-18).**Weak nesses:****No mention of established UX models**(e.g.,Norman’s Interaction Model,Garrett’s Elements of UX).**Conversion Rate Formula**(p.18)is presented without discussing**lim itations**(e.g.,how different industries measure CR differently).####**3.Integration of Theoretical and Practical Elements**Grade:Good(7/10)**thesis**links theory to practice**by discussing**UX research methods**(A/B testing,usability testing)and**C RO strategies**(real-time decision-making,statistical learning).However,it could better demonstrate**how theory informs practice**.**Example:**The**"UX Statistics and Their Influence on Conversion"**section(p.30)could have**app lied**theoretical principles(e.g.,Hick’s Law for decision-making speed)to explain why certain UX changes improve CR.####**4.Critical Analysis of Existing Literature**Grade:Fair(5/10)**thesis**sum mar izes**literature well but**l acks critical engagement**.It does not:Compare conflicting viewpoints(e.g.,**"Is usability more important than aesthetics?"**).Identify**g aps in research**(e.g.,**How does mobile UX differ from desktop in C RO?**).**Example:**The**"Difference Between UI and UX"**section(p.14)is**des criptive**but does not critique**how industry definitions vary**.####**5.Theoretical Contribution to the Field**Grade:Limited(4/10)**thesis**comp iles existing knowledge**but does not propose**new frameworks,models,or counter arguments**.It could have:Suggested**a new UX-C RO optimization model**.Crit iqu ed**common C RO myths**(e.g.,"Higher CR always means better UX").**Example:**The conclusion(p.32)states that**"UX design influences conversion rates"**,but this is**not a novel insight**.###**Final Assessment&Recommendations**Overall Grade:6/10(S atisf actory,but needs improvement in critical analysis and theoretical contribution).****Stre ng ths:**Clear structure and definitions of UX/UI and C RO.Good linkage between UX research methods and C RO.**Are as for Improvement:****D eeper theoretical engagement**(e.g.,reference cognitive psychology in UX).**More critical analysis**(e.g.,debate"best C RO techniques"rather than just listing them).**Original contribution**(e.g.,propose a new UX-C RO framework).**Suggested Enhance ments:**.**In cor porate advanced UX models**(e.g.,Nielsen’s He uristics,F ogg’s Behavior Model)..**Compare industry case studies**(e.g.,how Amazon vs.Apple approaches UX for CR)..**Pro pose a new hypothesis**(e.g.,"Min imal ist UI increases CR more than feature-rich UI").This would elevate the thesis from a**liter ature review**to a**the oret ically impactful study**.
